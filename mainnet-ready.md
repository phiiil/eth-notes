# Checklist to prepare for Mainnet

1. Write code, write tests, write code, write tests, ...
2. 
3. Install hardhat [solidity-coverage](https://hardhat.org/plugins/solidity-coverage.html) and raise the coverage to at least 100% ;-)
4. Deploy on a local node using hardhat node and test everything locally
5. Stage everything on a mainnet fork
  - Deploy the front-end on Vercel or any other hosting platform
  - Get a [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/transaction-simulator) developper account and test everything on a fork of mainnet
  - Get someone else to test it for you
